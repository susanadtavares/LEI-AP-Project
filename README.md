# 🚗 **Shopping Center Parking Management Platform**
This platform was designed to modernize and streamline the management of the “Há Tudo Aqui” shopping center’s multi-level parking facility. It supports three floors, each with 20 rows of 25 spaces, and serves both casual customers who pay per use and monthly subscribers with recurring payments.

It introduces dynamic pricing based on schedules, subscriber benefits, and an optimized system for allocating available parking spots. The application registers vehicle entries and exits automatically, tracks each customer through a unique identifier, and keeps all operational data up to date for efficient management.

In addition, it handles payment processing, subscription management, and adaptable tariff configurations to accommodate future pricing changes.
